# ENSE 370 Winter 2020 Final Exam â€“ Question 1

**PROMPT**: Consider a company that manufactures a variety of different types of shoes (e.g. sneakers, moccasins, boots, etc.) and sells them online. The company requires a software system that allows the management of its shoe inventory, tracking each product from its creation until its delivery to a customer.

PART A: Design the software system such that it is easy to support a large number of different types of shoes. As the company handles a large number of orders daily, you must design the software system so that it is easy to **create** the required types of shoes needed for each order. Use only **one** design pattern and state what design pattern you have used.

You must have an interface class `Shoe` in your design that contains a method `showShoeInfo()` whose purpose is to show information about that particular type of shoe. There must also be a public class called `ShoeInventoryDemo` that contains the `main()` method. Design all other classes that you may need, and you may add any methods or attributes that you wish. Draw the class diagram.

PART B: Write the Java implementation of **all** the classes in your design in Q1(a). In your `main()` method, you should create one instance of a shoe of the `Sneaker` type and another instance of the `Moccasin` type. Make each instance display its shoe information. State any assumptions that you have made.
